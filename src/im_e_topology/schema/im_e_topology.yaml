  TopologicalNode:
    description: 'For a detailed substation model a topological node is a set of connectivity
      nodes that, in the current network state, are connected together through any
      type of closed switches, including  jumpers. Topological nodes change as the
      current network state changes (i.e., switches, breakers, etc. change state).

      For a planning model, switch statuses are not used to form topological nodes.
      Instead they are manually created or deleted in a model builder tool. Topological
      nodes maintained this way are also called "busses".'

      \ hierarchy similar to a file directory structure. A power system related naming\
